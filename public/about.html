<p>About Me<br /></p>

<p>
  Hey there! I'm an energetic and self-motivated professional with a knack for
  customer service and technical support. My journey has been a whirlwind of
  exciting experiences and skills!

<br />

<p>
  Starting off at Braga Oil Company in Libya, I handled the daily grind of
  administrative tasks, coordinating with vendors and clients, and boosting
  customer satisfaction by 17%. Then, at Sirte Oil Company, I dove into the tech
  world as a Hardware Technician, mastering the art of setting up complex
  networks and keeping PCs virus-free.

<p>
  leap across continents brought me to Western Union in Mississauga, where I
  juggled cash and foreign currencies with precision, hit sales targets, and
  solved payment queries like a pro. My tech journey continued at ClickMox,
  where I developed cutting-edge autonomous vehicles for mining safety and
  surveys. Think rovers and drones equipped with powerful LiDAR scanners!

  At Rogers in Toronto, I connected with customers, troubleshot their
  connectivity issues, and recommended the latest tech goodies. My educational
  journey at Laurentian University equipped me with a Bachelor’s degree in
  Science (Computer Science concentration) and a bunch of honors and awards. I
  also honed my digital media and graphic design skills at Wood Green in
  Toronto.

  I’ve tackled projects like an AI Sudoku Puzzle Solver, a Web Store
  Application, and a Tic-Tac-Toe game, showcasing my programming prowess in
  languages like C++, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. My software
  toolbox includes Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Canvas, Maya, 3Ds
  Max, and MS Office.

  I'm a creative thinker, an outstanding team player, and a reliable individual
  with excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Fluent in Arabic and
  English, I bring a global perspective to everything I do. Let's create
  something amazing together!
